# Custom BCheck Scan

a

This repository stores some of my custom BCheck Scan configurations.
Its goal is to identify intriguing elements that warrant further manual testing.

Further information on [BCheck](https://github.com/PortSwigger/BChecks) can be found at the provided link.

## Repository Structure

The structure of this repository is as follows:

```bash
custom-bcheck-scan/
â”œâ”€â”€ passives                   # Passive analysis on the response to identify elements worthy of further investigation. ðŸ§¬ Be careful as certain rules may trigger excessive alerts ðŸ§¬
â”œâ”€â”€ common                     # Common check for misconfigurations for specific technology/framework/language
â”œâ”€â”€ sensitive                  # Common check for sensitive files
â”œâ”€â”€ vulnerability-classes      # Specifically targeting a particular type of vulnerability such as sqli, xss, etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ testing                    # Testing scan that I'm still experimenting with

## List of Burp Extensions that can be replace by BCheck scans in this repository

I'd like to express my gratitude to the creator of these Burp Extensions and some other open-sources tools. Their work has been instrumental in enabling my BCheck scans. While I've made every effort to recreate these extensions in BCheck, it's inevitable that mistakes may occur. If there are any areas I've overlooked, please don't hesitate to contribute and help improve them.

## How to test the BCheck scan

You have two options for testing the scan:

### Option 1: Import and Start Scanning
You can import all scans and begin scanning immediately.

### Option 2: Inspect Each Scan Using BSCode Editor
Follow the steps below to inspect each scan using the BSCode Editor:

1. Open BurpSuite and navigate to Extensions -> BCheck.
2. Click on 'New' -> Blank.
   ![bscode-editor](https://github.com/j3ssie/custom-bcheck-scan/assets/23289085/022236ad-25c6-4b0b-a425-5a9ba2cda024)
3. Copy any scan into the editor.
4. Right-click on any request/response and select 'Send to BCheck Editor'.
